# CLAUDE.md

**Read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) first — it is the canonical harness entrypoint.**
This file only restates the operating loop for Claude Code; `AGENTS.md` is the
source of truth for rules, required artifacts, and the definition of done.

## Operating Loop

At the start of every session:

1. Run `pwd` and confirm you are in the expected repository root.
2. Read `claude-progress.md`.
3. Read `feature_list.json`.
4. Review recent commits with `git log --oneline -5`.
5. Run `./init.sh`.
6. Check whether the baseline smoke or end-to-end path is already broken.

Then select exactly one unfinished feature and work only on that feature until
you either verify it or document why it is blocked.

## Rules

- One active feature at a time.
- Do not claim completion without runnable evidence.
- Do not rewrite the feature list to hide unfinished work.
- Do not remove or weaken tests just to make the task look complete.
- Use repository artifacts as the system of record.

## Completion Gate

A feature can move to `passing` only after the required verification succeeds
and the result is recorded. See the full Definition Of Done in `AGENTS.md`.

## Before You Stop

1. Update the progress log.
2. Update the feature state.
3. Record what is still broken or unverified.
4. Commit once the repository is safe to resume.
5. Leave a clean restart path for the next session.
